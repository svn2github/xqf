.SH NAME
xqf \- Quake/Quake2/Quake3/etc server browser and game launcher for X.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xqf
.RI [ options ] " files" ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B xqf
command.
This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution
because the original program does not have a manual page.
.PP
\fBXQF\fP is a 3D action game (such as Quake, sequels and derivatives)
server browser, similar to Window's GameSpy. It uses X and is written using
the GIMP Tool Kit, and uses QStat in the backend to retrieve server info.
.PP
With XQF you can search for Quake, Quake World, Quake2, Quake3, Return to 
Castle Wolfenstein, Hexen 2, Hexen World, Sin, Half-Life, Kingpin, 
Soldier of Fortun 1/2, Tribes 2, Heretic 2, Unreal, Unreal Tournament, 
Unreal Tournament 2003, Rune and Descent 3, and look at lots of 
information about the servers. XQF can spawn your client into a
selected server with customized options. You can also apply filters while
searching for servers, trimming full or empty servers, for example.
.SH OPTIONS
XQF doesn't accept any command line option at the moment, except for debug
setting.
.TP
.B \-d N
Sets debug level to `N', where N is greater than 0. If N is greater than 5,
XQF will output a lot of debug information.
