-Added the ability to have multiple filters.  Right now the
 number is set at compile time to 10 (see xqf.h:MAX_SERVER_FILTERS
 if you want to change it).  You can name the filters to 
 whatever you want.  The first filter "None" cannot be changed.
 It is there for a reason (future feature). The last filter selected
 is remembered each time you exit (if you use the menu File->exit).
-Version changed to 0.9.6a-beta
