Aug 19, 2001: Bill Adams <bill@evilbill.org>

- Patch by  Ludwig Nussel ludwig.nussel@gmx.de to fix some of the
  q3a game types, options for setting fs_game on the command line and
  r3a hack for the vm_* settings.
  
Aug 9, 2001: Alex Burger <alex@fragit_dot_net>
-Changed Quake3 protocol version to 66 to support
 latest Quake3 patch.  Change located in game.c

July 07, 2001, Bill Adams <bill@evilbill.org>
- Added "Game Type" filter.  Now you can filter on 
  CTF, TDM, etc. and the mod.
- Merged Jordi's changes (see below).
  
June 8, 2001, Jordi Mallach <jordi@sindominio.net>
- Big internationalization patch for XQF.
  Adds intl/ and po/ subdirs, and adds the gettext marks
  to every .c that needs it. Modified configure.in and 
  the Makefile.am's to support gettext. From now on,
  every string in the code should be wrapped inside
  gettext() calls, and .c's should add a <libintl.h>
  if they don't have it already.
  Some issues with the current code remain (untranslatable
  strings), thats a work in progress.
- Initial, incomplete Spanish translation (po/es.po).
- changed configure.in so it barfs about qstat << 2.4c.

June 5, 2001: Alex Burger <alex@fragit_dot_net>
-Tribes 2 games can now be launched.  Created a t2_exec
 function. If a name is specified in Player Profile, it 
 is used on the command line to log in.  This would only
 work if you have saved your password in the game.
 Otherwise it launches and prompts for login.

April 20, 2001: Alex Burger <alex@fragit_dot_net>
-Now requires qstat2.4c.  Removed fixes to Tribes 2 code
 for qstat2.4b as qstat2.4c fixes the problems
-Added t2_analyze_serverinfo function to decode Game and
 GameType columns for Tribes 2.

April 19, 2001: Alex Burger <alex@fragit_dot_net>
-Changed version to 0.9.6g
-Added Tribes 2 support.  Tribes 2 support requires at
 least QSTAT 2.4b.  As I do not even have Tribes 2 I
 can not test launching the game but it if it launches
 the same as Quake2, then it should work.  More work
 will be done to ensure the player and server info is
 being decoded correctly etc.

Feb 14, 2001: Bill Adams <bill@evil.inetarena.com>
-Oh dear god, I think I fixed the core dumps related
 to the reference counting on the server structures.
 At least to the best of my ability, I cannot make
 the server references increase or decrease
 over time: i.e. the program always exits with
 a reference count of one on all server structures.
 I could not figure out why it was 1 and not zero
 but I will deal with that later.

Feb 13, 2001: Bill Adams <bill@evil.inetarena.com>
-Changed version to 0.9.6f, added announcement dir
 and announcement.

Feb 07, 2001: Bill Adams <bill@evil.inetarena.com>
-Fixed the core dumps (for the most part) for real.
 The only time I have seen a core dump at this point
 is when updating a master list where there are not
 any servers already in the list.  However, once
 you have a list of servers, you should be able to
 update/refresh at will without any problems.
-Lots of debugging code with the debug(...) call. If
 you want lots of output, use -d 3, to see the servers
 it is parsing use -d 4. For an insane amount of output
 use -d 7.  Debug levels greater than three will
 will have so much output that it will most likely 
 slow down the program.
-Added a fair number of comments to the code.

Jan 31, 2001: Bill Adams <bill@evil.inetarena.com>
-Made it so OSP game types show up correctly.

Jan 24, 2001: Bill Adams <bill@evil.inetarena.com>
-Fixed the game.c hack.  Bad bug.
	
Jan 23, 2001: Bill Adams <bill@evil.inetarena.com>
-Did BAD hack to game.c::q3_exec( ) so that when
 connecting to an arena (rocket arena 3) server,
 it will "+set sv_pure 0 +set vm_* 0" on the command
 line so arena will load properly.  As a side note,
 one should use vm_* all at zero unless you have a 
 really good reason to do otherwise.
	
Jan 21, 2001: Bill Adams <bill@evil.inetarena.com>
-Changed "Insert" behavior.  Now Insert brings up the add
 server dialog while SHIFT+Insert adds a server from the 
 server list to your favorites.  I am not sure about 
 this because one can also use CTRL+N to add another 
 server via a dialog. But I am told the Insert == Dialog
 is how GameSpy works so there it is.
-q3_exec now adds +set fs_game SSSS for either the
 fs_game or gamename.  This should improve connecting
 as it will load the mod when Q3A starts.
-Added a function in util.c to get the value for
 any server variable that shows up in the server info
 pane.  This is a setup for arbitrary server filters
 and for...
-q3_exec will now check for <quake3exec>protoNN before
 it just runs <quake3exec>.  To use this feature you
 have to configure xqf to point to the FULL path to
 your q3 exec script.  Then you can put scripts that
 are named with the "protoNN" on the end to have xqf
 automatically connect to the right server.  See
 the instructions in the README.  This allows you (if
 you have LOTS of disk space) to be able to connect to
 multiple point-releases.
-added -d N command line option to get more debugging
 output.  Added debug.c and debug.h to facilitate this
 new feature.  Only a few code segments use the new
 debug() function.
-added self to AUTHORS.
-Version now 0.9.6e-beta.
-Fixed config.in to have the correct version.
	
	
Jan 7, 2001: Alex Burger <alex@fragit_dot_net>

Jan 7, 2001: Ludwig Nussel <l-n@users.sourceforge.net>
-Added hl_analyze_serverinfo function to display gamedir and
 gamename in columns for Half-Life servers.  For example:
 cstrike and Counter Strike
-Added un_analyze_serverinfo function to display gametype and
 gamestyle in columns for Unreal Tournament servers.  For example:
 game_unrealfortress and hardcore
-Modified q2_analyze_serverinfo function to display gamename
 in columns for Quake2 servers.  For example: Lithium II V1.23

Jan 2, 2001: Alex Burger <alex@fragit_dot_net>
-Change g_gametype of 8 to ' mod ' instead of TeamTournament which 
 TeamArena uses in the in-game browser.

Jan 1, 2001: Alex Burger <alex@fragit_dot_net>
-Now executes the file PreLaunch from the ~/.qf directory when launching a 
 game for use with ICQ scripts etc.  Toggle on / off using Preferences / 
 Appearance 

Dec 28, 2000: Alex Burger <alex@fragit_dot_net>
-Modified game.c to query for protocol 48 Quake3 servers instead of the
 qstat default by using "-q3m,48"

Dec 27, 2000: Bill Adams <bill@evil.inetarena.com>
-Adding a server with the Insert key now gives feedback on the status bar.
-Fixed the core dump.  Perhaps?  So I hope. (added server_ref to 
 server.c::server_add( )). This will require verification on the reference
 count but it seemed to fix it for me.

Dec 23, 2000: Alex Burger <alex@fragit_dot_net>
-Added new Quake3 game types to support Team Arena.  Note: g_gametype values
 of 5 to 8 are now defined by id for Team Arena.  Mod authors usually use 5.
 XQF will only show the new values if the game version is 1.27 until we find
 out what the mod authors are doing.
-Changed game types to not use < > around the type in the Game column

Dec 22, 2000: Bill Adams <bill@evil.inetarena.com>
-New column in the server list to show if you need a password or not. If
 you do a lock icon appears.
-If a Q3A server has all non private-client slots filled, a yellow man
 appears next to the map.  The icon is slightly different for color blind
 people so don't tell me about it unless you are color blind and need the
 difference greater.
-You can press "Insert" to add a server to the Favorites list while in
 anything but the Favorites list.  Pressing "Delete" while in the Favorites
 list will remove it from Favorites.  "Enter" or "Return" in any list will
 will connect you to the server.
-Moved the filter selection to the "Server" menu pulldown.
-It still dumps core. :(. There seems to be a reference counting bug
 with the server lists.  If you want to watch it happen, set up a
 "mod contains wfa" filter, update the Q3A ID list, apply the filter, and
 press refresh repeatedly.

Dec 20th 2000: Bill Adams <bill@evil.inetarena.com>
--The filter name now appears in the status bar.
--Version changed to 0.9.6b-beta
--There are still core dumps :(.

Dec 04th 2000: Bill Adams <bill@evil.inetarena.com>
-Added the ability to have multiple filters.  Right now the
 number is set at compile time to 10 (see xqf.h:MAX_SERVER_FILTERS
 if you want to change it).  You can name the filters to 
 whatever you want.  The first filter "None" cannot be changed.
 It is there for a reason (future feature). The last filter selected
 is remembered each time you exit (if you use the menu File->exit).
-Version changed to 0.9.6a-beta
