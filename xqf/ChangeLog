-Change g_gametype of 8 to ' mod ' instead of TeamTournament which 
 TeamArena uses in the in-game browser.

Jan 1, 2001: Alex Burger <alex@fragit.net>
-Now executes the file PreLaunch from the ~/.qf directory when launching a 
 game for use with ICQ scripts etc.  Toggle on / off using Preferences / 
 Appearance

-Modified game.c to query for protocol 48 Quake3 servers instead of the
 qstat default by using "-q3m,48"

Dec 27, 2000: Bill Adams <bill@evil.inetarena.com>
-Adding a server with the Insert key now gives feedback on the status bar.
-Fixed the core dump.  Perhaps?  So I hope. (added server_ref to 
 server.c::server_add( )). This will require verification on the reference
 count but it seemed to fix it for me.

Dec 23, 2000: Alex Burger <alex@fragit.net>
-Added new Quake3 game types to support Team Arena.  Note: g_gametype values
 of 5 to 8 are now defined by id for Team Arena.  Mod authors usually use 5.
 XQF will only show the new values if the game version is 1.27 until we find
 out what the mod authors are doing.
-Changed game types to not use < > around the type in the Game column

Dec 22, 2000: Bill Adams <bill@evil.inetarena.com>
-New column in the server list to show if you need a password or not. If
 you do a lock icon appears.
-If a Q3A server has all non private-client slots filled, a yellow man
 appears next to the map.  The icon is slightly different for color blind
 people so don't tell me about it unless you are color blind and need the
 difference greater.
-You can press "Insert" to add a server to the Favorites list while in
 anything but the Favorites list.  Pressing "Delete" while in the Favorites
 list will remove it from Favorites.  "Enter" or "Return" in any list will
 will connect you to the server.
-Moved the filter selection to the "Server" menu pulldown.
-It still dumps core. :(. There seems to be a reference counting bug
 with the server lists.  If you want to watch it happen, set up a
 "mod contains wfa" filter, update the Q3A ID list, apply the filter, and
 press refresh repeatedly.

Dec 20th 2000: Bill Adams <bill@evil.inetarena.com>
--The filter name now appears in the status bar.
--Version changed to 0.9.6b-beta
--There are still core dumps :(.

Dec 04th 2000: Bill Adams <bill@evil.inetarena.com>
-Added the ability to have multiple filters.  Right now the
 number is set at compile time to 10 (see xqf.h:MAX_SERVER_FILTERS
 if you want to change it).  You can name the filters to 
 whatever you want.  The first filter "None" cannot be changed.
 It is there for a reason (future feature). The last filter selected
 is remembered each time you exit (if you use the menu File->exit).
-Version changed to 0.9.6a-beta

Nov 26th 2000: Bill Adams <bill@evil.inetarena.com>

 put in multiple server filters.

 refresh.  Thanks to slashdev for the fix.
-Now requires QStat 2.4a

Nov 12th 2000: Alex Burger <alex@fragit.net>
-Changed Copy+ menu to use double spaces instead of commas to separate
 fields.  Added 'of' for current players / max players. Eg: 5 of 10

Nov 5th 2000: Alex Burger <alex@fragit.net>
-Add call to clear list to end of function server_clist_build_filtered
 to prevent segfault on some computers due to server list that is emptied
 after a player filter is applied

Oct 27th 2000: xqf-0.9.4f2 - Alex Burger <alex@fragit.net>
-Added Copy+ menu option - copies the following server info to the clipboard:
