Need to find a good format for this file.  Would like to record who entered
the bug, the date it was entered, who fixed it and when.

??/??/????
- If XQF queries a master server and it has no entries, it will wipe out
  the existing list for that master.
- rcon for half-life is broken

- In Player Filter, reported crashes. Up/Down buttons are plain whacky. (FIXED)
