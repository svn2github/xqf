Need to find a good format for this file.  Would like to record who entered
the bug, the date it was entered, who fixed it and when.

- Do the following: 
    -Set'Show only configured games' on
    -only configure Quake2, Unreal and UT2003
    -Add a UT2003 server (www.fragit.net:7777) (enter ip, port and make sure
     you click on the game list and choose UT2003 even if it's already
     selected).
    -Add a Quake2 server (www.fragit.net:27912) but do NOT click the game
     selection - it should already be defaulted to Quake2.

    The Quake2 server will have the UT2003 icon.

    If you actually select Quake2 in the second step, it works.

- If XQF queries a master server and it has no entries, it will wipe out
  the existing list for that master.
- rcon for half-life is broken

- In Player Filter, reported crashes. Up/Down buttons are plain whacky. (FIXED)
