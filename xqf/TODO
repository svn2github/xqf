If there is nothing interesting on TV:
- Configure option for home directory as well as global directory
- update game types for Q3 mods - move to external file
- Ability to delete servers from non-Favorites (really? -- ln)
- Game specific filters.  No use seeing a Lithium filter choice when looking
  at UT2003 servers
- More general server filters so one can filter based on any server var.
- Search for server like control f does for player
- Ability to launch a game without connecting to a server - right click on
  game in source list - Launch
- get rid of the switch for saving player info, make seperate functions for
  each game
- Redial feature:  User configurable options
- make rcon window non-modal

Jobs you can do if your holidays are boring:
- dynamic dialogs using libglade
- GTK2
- Multiple Favorites
- parse text file(xml?) to fill struct games[]
