- Multiple Favorites
- Detection if map is installed (req. home dir option)
- update game types for Q3 mods - move to external file
- Ability to delete servers from non-Favorites
- Game specific filters.  No use seeing a Lithium filter choice when looking
  at UT2003 servers
- Search for server like control f does for player
- Option to treat bots as non-players.  Hate going to a server that has 6 
  'players' to find them all bots
- Ability to launch a game without connecting to a server - right click on
  game in source list - Launch
- get rid of the switch for saving player info, make seperate functions for
  each game


Required for XQF 0.9.11
- Half-Life launch fix

Required for XQF 1.0:
- Configure option for home directory as well as global directory
- Fix the server core dumps! (are there any left?)
- improve performance with huge server lists (halflife), maybe by serverside
  filtering
- More general server filters so one can filter based on any server var.
- Redial feature:  User configurable options
- If you disable 'Show hostnames' and you select a server and do a DNS
  Lookup, it shouldn't automatically enable Show hostnames.  Should make
  'Show hostnames' simply enable / disable displaying of a host name if it
  exists in the server record.  Add a 'Resolve hostnames on Update / Refresh'
  option to set whether or not to do the resolving on update / refresh
