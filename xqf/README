  - Remote server administration tool (rcon) for QuakeWorld, HexenWorld,
      Quake2, Quake3: Arena, Half-Life, Sin, Kingpin, Heretic2 servers


REQUIREMENTS
------------

 - A UNIX computer and C compiler (gcc)
 - X11 (X Window System)
 - GTK+ 1.2.5+ http://www.gtk.org
 - QStat 2.4a http://www.activesw.com/people/steve/qstat.html
 - [Optionally] wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/wget/ to retrieve server 
   listings from the Web
 - [Optionally] gzip http://www.gnu.org/software/gzip/gzip.html 
   or bzip2 http://www.muraroa.demon.co.uk/ for data file compression


COMPILATION
-----------

Untar the xqf-X.X.XX.tar.gz archive, change directory to xqf-X.X.XX,

   ./configure
   make

To install the binary become root if necessary and run "make install".


USAGE
-----

QStat 2.4a is required.  It must be in your $PATH.

Note: Gamespy's master servers use an authentication sequence that is not
supported by QStat 2.4a.  This means that you can not query a Gamespy master
using QStat and XQF.  The Unreal Tournament master server at Epic also
uses a Gamespy style master server but does not require authentication.
This means that you can query Epic's UT master server using:

gmaster://unreal.epicgames.com:28900

Please see the QStat documentation for more information on the types of
master servers.

QStat home page is http://www.activesw.com/people/steve/qstat.html

Server list navigation:
 - Left double-click launches game on selected server.
 - Right click pops up server option menu.
 - Middle click selects one server and refreshes its information.

XQF can be customized via GTK's rc files.  XQF parses files
/etc/gtkrc, $HOME/.gtkrc, $HOME/.qf/gtkrc.

When adding a master server, the following prefixes are support:

master://	(regular master server)
gmaster://	(Gamespy style master server)
http://		(html page containing list)

Not specifying a prefix will default to master://

QUAKE 3 ARENA SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS (AKA HACK)
--------------------------------------------

In Q3A, clients and servers can only talk with each other
if they are using the same protocol.  The protocol in Q3A
is defined by a number.  So, for instance, Q3A 1.17 uses
protocol 45 wile 1.27 uses protocol 48.  During the switch-
over time after ID releases a new point release, it can be 
frustrating to not be able to connect to any server one wants.
However, if you have lots of disk space, it is possible to
get around this problem.

I (Bill 'EvilBill' Adams) will outline what I did to get it 
so I can play both 1.17 and 1.27 Q3A games without much fuss. 
For reference, my Q3A is installed under /usr/local/games/...
and I have a symlink from /usr/local/bin/quake3 to ../games/quake3/quake3.

(1) Rename /usr/local/games/quake3 (as I used to have it) to
/usr/local/games/quake3-1.17.

(2) mkdir /usr/local/games/quake3; cd /usr/local/games/quake3

(3) cp -Rav ../quake3-1.17 .

(4) Install the point release, copy all of the TA pk3 files into 
baseq3.  Remove any old mods from 1.17.

(5) cd..; mv quake3 quake3-1.27

(6) Edit both of the quake3 scripts so the directories all match, here is
the script I use for 1.17: (/usr/local/games/quake3-1.17/quake3)

==begin==
#!/bin/sh
# Needed to make symlinks/shortcuts work.
# Run Quake III with some default arguments
 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/games/quake3-1.17"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
 
cd "/usr/local/games/quake3-1.17"
quake="./quake3.x86"
"$quake" +set in_dgamouse 1 $*
exit $?                                                                        ==cut==

(7) [as root], cd into /usr/local/bin.  Make symlinks for each of the
Q3A directories that correspond to the protocol each uses. So:
  ln -s ../games/quake3-1.17 quake3proto45
  ln -s ../games/quake3-1.27 quake3proto48
  ln -s ../games/quake3-1.27 quake3 

Note the last one is there as the default.

(8) Get a very (CVS) recent version of xqf. You will need >=0.9.6e-beta. 
Set up the executable for quake3 such that it is the FULL path to 
quake3, in my case I entered /usr/local/bin/quake3.  This is VERY important
because of the hack I used where I put 'protoNN' on the end of whatever
you entered for the program and see if xqf can fopen it.  Without the full
path, chances are that xqf will not find it.

If you have problems, run xqf with "-d 5" on the command line.  This
will give you some hints as to that which it is looking.
